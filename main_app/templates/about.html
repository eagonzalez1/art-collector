  Mary Chirinos was born in Valencia, Venezuela.

  My work tends to focus on the harmonic structure of the universe and the relationship with man evolution. I have been experimenting with images and the principles of Sacred Geometry, seeking mystical and metaphysical paths that would try to capture contemplation and meditation on the energy of the cosmic space, to open mystical channels and to explore the spiritual world where philosophy and divinity merge; where the mind and the soul are seduced between "the sacred and the profane".
